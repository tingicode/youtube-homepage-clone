A while back, I developed a strong interest in Software Engineering and decided to explore this field on my own.

After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I set out to apply core concepts from these languages in a practical way.

And this is my first ever project. 

Here, I recreated a clone of a YouTube homepage.

Hope you enjoy.
